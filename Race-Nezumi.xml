			<p>
				The Nezumi live in villages and outposts hidden among the morass. Their homes tenuously borders with those of the violent oni-worshipping ogres. While the ogres and nezumi do not get along, that does not mean they are so different. Most nezumi are raised to become mercenaries, using violence as the main source of income for the village. Those that can't cut it wind up as fishermen, foragers, or craftsmen to support the warrior class. Regardless, every nezumi moves with a speed and agility that other races would have a hard time matching.

				Some nezumi have migrated outside of the swamp to the larger settlements, especially the city surrounding Eiganjo. A small community of them make an honest but meager living on the periphery of human society.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">The Nezumi often find lives for themselves as thieves, ninja, or samurai, working for the highest bidder that will tolerate their underhanded tactics. Nezumi are known to be agile and clever, making up for what they lack in outright strength. They use misdirection and chemical attacks to turn the odds in their favor. Some are even known to summon and control swarms of insects or rats to distract opponents. No tactic is too low to get the job done. An enemy who is aware of the Nezumi is never too cautious, while an ignorant fool dies in stupefication. Some Nezumi are so good at what they do, the elites of society keep one on retainer to take care of tasks requiring stealth, infiltration, or assassination.</p>
			<h4>City Outcasts</h4>
			<p>Most of the other races are fairly ignorant of or blatantly discriminatory towards Nezumi. This happens far more to Nezumi than towards any other race living within human settlements. Many see them as desperate street urchins at best and disgusting, thieving parasites at worst. Their reputation for using underhanded tricks hasn't earned them any favors, though one wonders if the discrimination or the dishonesty came first.</p>
